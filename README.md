# Strassen-Method
An implementation of the Strassen Method in order to multiply two matrices. Only works on matrices with a size that is a power of 2. The final matrix and all of the S values (from the Strassen Method) are both printed and written to an output file.
This was given to me a homework assignemnt for my algorithms class.
Made in C++
